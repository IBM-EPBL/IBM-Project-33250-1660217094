##  PROJECT DESCRIPION 

### PROJECT IDEA 

## INTRODUCTION:
When it comes to tracking expenses, you can make your system as simple as collecting receipts and organizing them once a month.
You might get a little more information from other expense tracking systems (listing them in a spreadsheet, using money management software or even choosing an online application), but all methods have one thing in common: you have to get in the habit of thinking about your expenses.
It’s very easy to misplace a receipt or forget about any cash you spent. You may even think that a cup of coffee or a trip to the vending machine isn’t worth tracking — although those little expenses can add up amazingly fast.
There are all sorts of opportunities to throw a kick into your plan to track expenses. You have to get in the habit of doing so, to reduce those lapses, and make sure that the data you’re basing financial decisions on is solid.
This project will request the clients to add their expenses and in view of their costs ,wallet status will be refreshed which will be noticeable to the client.
